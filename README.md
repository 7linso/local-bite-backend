# local-bite (backend)

backend for simple recipe app cause i wanna learn vue

## Installation

this is really simple backend written with express so setup is easy-peasy

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
BUT you don't have .env . i am a troll :)

## desc

iâ€™m learning vue and to have some practice with it i came up with cute idea

local-bite lets people share how they cook dishes where they live.
everyone eats. everyone cooks differently. why keep great recipes secret?
show how you make your favs in your area and discover how others do it, too.
(hot take: pineapple on pizza is a big no-no)

and for that i need backend... and db... and all of that...
i was like 'oh, great, i am so excited to learn smth new' and then '...holly-molly, i need back...'
so here we are, stupid me

# tech stack
- express
- mongoose (mongo) + cloudinary for storage
- cors, cookie-parser, jsonwebtoken and bcryptjs for auth
- node-geocoder i guess for geocoding
- coming soon

# api testing

i am using [**REST Client**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension for vs code to easily test api endpoints directly from the `.rest` file
